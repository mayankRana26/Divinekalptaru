Divine Kalptaru
YOGA FOR COOL MIND
Our goal at Divine Kalptaru is to impart the ancient art and science of "Yoga" in a way that would enable our pupils to actively contribute to the advancement of humanity.




WHY CHOOSE DIVINE HAPPNESS
We are one of the finest yoga academies in Rishikesh and a school that has received international certification and registration. We have gained notoriety on a global scale as a result of our partnership with the Yoga Alliance USA and the top yoga instructors, who have spent years perfecting the practise. We've become known as one of the top yoga schools in Rishikesh, India as a result of this. As a way to share the benefits of yoga, we have worked with websites like Book Yoga Retreats, Book Retreats, and Trip Advisor over the years.




What We Do
OUR PHILOSOPHY
Yoga
Realising one's true nature, achieving inner peace, and finding relief from suffering are the three main aims of yoga. Even a basic understanding of yoga's principles can help one's yoga practise and promote more calm, fulfilment, and well-being in their lives. Although it can take years of study and reflection to fully understand yoga, this is not to say that it is impossible.

Our programmes are based on quality.
Our comprehensive yoga teacher training programme includes a wide range of topics to help students develop the skills needed to plan safe, effective, and meaningful yoga programmes. Through the integration of physical practise with philosophical study, meditation, and teaching techniques, our yoga teacher training programmes provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them to share the advantages of yoga with others.
